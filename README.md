# StackExpConViz

**StackExpConViz** is a Java-based visualization tool designed to demonstrate the conversion between different types of stack-based expressions: Prefix, Infix, and Postfix. It offers an interactive interface using **Swing** for step-by-step conversion guidance and educational support.

## Features
- Supports all six types of conversions:
  - **Prefix to Postfix**
  - **Prefix to Infix**
  - **Postfix to Prefix**
  - **Postfix to Infix**
  - **Infix to Prefix**
  - **Infix to Postfix**
- Additional functionalities:
  - **String Reversal** using Stack in the console.
  - **Bracket Balancing** to check expression validity.
  - The expression input field actively validates syntax in real time.
  - Expressions can be entered with or without spaces.
  - A collection of example expressions is available for quick demonstrations.
  - The **Info Tab** provides an explanation of the algorithms used for conversion.
- Visual representation of stack operations for improved understanding.
- Step-by-step conversion process with notifications explaining each action.
- **Auto-conversion feature** for faster demonstrations.
- Auto conversion speed can be animated as desired.
